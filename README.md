# Discord Ticket System by AstroGD
A ticket system for Discord to reach the users questions more easily and never loose a message in chat.

If you have any question feel free to contact me via mail to support@astrogd.eu or send a dm to AstroGD#3416

## Features
Getting in touch with the team on a server with many members can be very difficult and frustrating. Your question or the teams answer might get lost in the chat and you need to scroll and search if you want to re-read the messages. Thats why the ticketsystem is for you!
If you have questions you can start a ticket and the team will be notified about your issue. But there's more: You'll even get a DM from the bot if your case updates so that you also won't miss an update ever again.

So what are are you waiting for? Download ticketsystem now and make reaching you and your team easier than ever before!
